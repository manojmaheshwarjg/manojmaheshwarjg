## What I'm About

Product Manager by profession, currently doing my MS in AI at University at Buffalo. Making the jump from writing PRDs to writing actual code - it's been humbling, educational, and occasionally involves way too much Stack Overflow.
```python
class Manoj:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "Product Manager → AI Student"
        self.age = 27
        self.status = "Converting product thinking into code"
        self.current_location = "Buffalo, NY"
        
    def daily_routine(self):
        return ["Classes", "Assignments", "Building stuff", "Debugging life choices"]
```

## The Journey

**Product Manager** with experience shipping MVPs and leading cross-functional teams. Built products from 0→1, written more PRDs than I can count, and now learning to build the things I used to spec out.

**Current Focus:** MS in AI at UB — diving deep into machine learning, algorithms, and discovering that understanding the theory is very different from implementing it. Late-night coding sessions have replaced late-night stakeholder meetings.

## Current Chapter

**MS in Artificial Intelligence** | University at Buffalo  
Bridging the gap between product strategy and technical execution. Learning that "it can't be that hard" is famous last words for any coding project.

## What's Next

Building at the intersection of product and AI. Figuring out how to translate years of product thinking into actual working code. It's a process, but that's what makes it interesting.
