## ü§ñ From PRDs to Pull Requests: A Tragedy in Multiple Acts

I'm a Product Manager desperately trying to `git checkout` of management and `git commit` to becoming a tech bro at 27. While my friends are saying "I do," I'm in a committed relationship with compiler errors saying "No you don't."

```python
def manoj():
    age = 27
    status = "In a toxic relationship with Python syntax errors"
    daily_activity = ["Writing PRDs", "Pretending to understand ML algorithms", 
                      "Questioning life choices at 2 AM", "Submitting homework late"]
    friends_status = "Getting married and having kids"
    my_status = "Trying to remember what 'endemic' means in AI class"
    return {"reality": "This wasn't in the PRD I wrote for my life"}
```

## üöÄ My Superpower Stats (and Tragic Flaws)

| Skill | Level | Truth Behind the Scenes |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| MVP Development | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Can launch any product in 90 days but can't fix my own sleep schedule |
| PRD Writing | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Written 28+ PRDs but can't write working code without 57 Stack Overflow tabs |
| Technical Understanding | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | "Yes, I totally understand what that algorithm does" *Googles frantically* |
| Debugging | ‚≠ê | "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" |
| Dating Life | 404 | Error: Not Found (too busy debugging) |

## üéì MS AI: Mistakes & Suffering in Artificial Intelligence

Currently at University at Buffalo pursuing my MS in AI, or as I like to call it: "Mostly Suffering in Algorithmic Incomprehension." While my classmates are building neural networks, I'm still trying to understand why my "Hello World" program crashed.

> "Education is important, but submitting assignments at 11:58 PM for a midnight deadline is importanter." - Me, probably

## üö¢ Projects I Built vs. What I Actually Contributed

### üß† Jerrydata - The BI Tool For Executives
* What I tell people: "Developed an AI-driven Business Intelligence platform"
* Reality: Mostly just changed the colors on the dashboard until people stopped complaining

### ‚ú® Spellmint - AI-powered Planning
* What I tell people: "Built in under 60 days with less than $500"
* Reality: Spent 59 days procrastinating, then panic-coded for 24 hours straight

### üè¢ Hurrae Ventures - Team as a Service
* What I tell people: "Generated $15K in revenue serving US startups"
* Reality: Still haven't figured out how to generate $15 from my GitHub projects

## üìä My GitHub Activity (Mostly Starring Repos I'll Never Use)

## üí¨ Why I'm Like This

* At 27, I spend Friday nights debugging while my Instagram feed is flooded with wedding photos and baby announcements
* My idea of a good time is finally getting my code to compile without errors (it's happened twice)
* I've set a new record for most times saying "I have no idea what I'm doing" in a single day (42)
* My browser history is 90% "how to exit vim" and "is it too late to learn coding at 27"
* I write better commit messages than text messages to potential dates

## üîÆ Future Plans

```javascript
const future = {
  career: "Something involving AI that doesn't involve me actually coding it",
  relationship: await fetch('https://willihaveagirlfriend.com'), // Promise pending for 27 years
  skills: ["Eventually understanding Git beyond push and pull", "Learning to code without crying"],
  realistic_goals: ["Submit assignments more than 2 minutes before deadline", 
                   "Stop pretending I understand when professors talk about neural networks"]
};
```
