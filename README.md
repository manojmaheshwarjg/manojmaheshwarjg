## ü§ñ The AI-Powered Product Guy Who Ships Fast

I transform caffeine into MVPs faster than you can say "sprint planning." With 4+ years of experience building AI solutions and digital products, I'm the person you call when you need to get from concept to launch in 90 days or less.

```python
def manoj():
    skills = ["Product Management", "AI Solutions", "Agile Methodologies", "MVP Development"]
    caffeine_level = "critically high"
    current_status = "Building cool stuff while pursuing MS in AI at UB"
    return {"mission": "Creating products people actually want to use"}
```
